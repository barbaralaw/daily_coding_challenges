# Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* I love a good puzzle and this is quicker than a crossword
* Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
* Love ~~to smash the~~ friendly competition
* What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it?
